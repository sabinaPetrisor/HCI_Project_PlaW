# HCI_Project_PlaW.
PLaW is a multi-user educational game aiming to combine learning and casual gaming in order to bring a fun and enriching experience. By playing you can better grasp, as well as test your knowledge on the most important aspects regarding Web technologies, all the while taking care of a virtual pet together with your friends. On the studying side, you have information on the most important topics divided into chapters that unlock daily as to make the information easier to process, with a quiz at the end of each sub chapter for you to test your knowledge and earn rewards in the form of coins. You may also test your skills once per day in the daily quiz. On the other hand you have the pet and social aspect of the game, with a chat option to facilitate communication with your teammates and a shop to spend your hard earned coins and customize the game and your pet's looks. The feature bringing the two sides together is, of course, the pet itself, as you need to feed it daiy with food bought using coins earned from the quizzes.
