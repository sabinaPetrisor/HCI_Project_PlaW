        <h2>1. Abstract</h2>
        <p>Nowadays, the internet is widely spread, almost every person on the planet has access to it. One of the important components is the World Wide Web, or shortly, Web. Along with the increased usage of Web, there is also a multitude of people wanting to discover what Web is and how it works. Searching on the internet about this subject, there is a never ending list of websites and applications that provide explanations on the topic. The great problem is that these ways of learning do not pay attention to people's need to feel enjoyment while achieving new skills and knowledge.

        <h2>2. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Our application aims to help people who want to learn about the Web in a unique and fun way. We created this application in the desire to facilitate the search for information in long learning sessions. At the same time, the learning process is intertwined with the fun of having taking care of a digital pet together with a group of friends.</p>

                <h3>4.1. Traditional</h3>
                <p>
                    Being in the form of a website, the project uses the traditional interaction. This means applying keyboard inputs and mouse inputs.

                <p>
                    As an Android application, the project uses the haptic interaction. It consists of tapping and dragging with the fingers on the screen.

                <p>
                    Also shortly called GUI, our project uses Graphical User Interface by using suggestive icons instead of pure text.

                <p>
                    Our project contains navigation patterns, such as module tabs (apparent in category tabs in shop page), a home icon in the Desktop version and expandable and categorized chapter blocks.

                <p>
                    These patterns are contained in the Message page where the user can communicate with their teammates and also the My Group page where the progress of each team member is shown.

                <p>
                    To keep players engaged and to encourage every day log in, the game provides rewards in coins from quizes and every day unlocking of a new lesson. Also, the player needs to log in daily to feed their pet.

            <h2>6. Important aspects of User Flow</h2>
            <p>
                The user has the possibility to log in if they have an account, or register if they do not have one.
            </p>
            <p>
                When registering, the user must enter their desired username and also enter one or two emails of their teammates. The program sends emails to the corespondent adresses and waits for all invites to be accepted. Then the users can choose their desired pet to adopt.
            </p>
            <p>
                The users can feed the pet daily. They can also enter the shop to buy items for their pet.
            </p>
            <p>
                The user can learn a new lesson every day. At the end of that lesson, they can answer to a quiz based on that lesson and if the answer is correct they receive a small amount of coins, and nothing if the answer is incorrect.
            </p>
            <p>
                The user can access previous lessons and answer to quizes on that subject.
            </p>
            <p>
                The user can answer to a daily random quiz from previously learned lessons which contains a question with three possible answers, from which only one answer is correct. This represents the fastest way of making coins, as answering correctly to the daily quiz gives them the greatest amount of coins possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                The user can access the menu in the top bar and access their account, their group status and settings page.
            </p>
            <p>
                The group members can communicate in the messages page.
            </p>

            <h2>7. Affective Factors and Emotions</h2>
            <p>
                On the positive side, the user could feel:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Warm-hearted, excited and relaxed when seeing their pet.</li>
                <li>Satisfied and optimistic when answering correctly to a quiz, receiving coins, completing a new chapter and buying something new from shop.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Overall, these positive emotions lead to a much more motivated and relaxed learning, and also enables hopeful and clear thinking.</p>

            <p>
                On the negative side, the user could feel sad, frustrated or angry when wrongly answering to a quiz and not receiving the maximum possible amount of coins, which leads to demotivation and could also affect the life outside the game of the user.
